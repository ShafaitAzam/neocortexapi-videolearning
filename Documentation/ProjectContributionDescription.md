Our project goal was to investigate and test the existing video learning project. Later on we have also started testing the migrated video learning project. Initially I have forked the repository(old project) which was mentioned on the project description documents. we opened two branches in that repository so that me and my team mate can work on their own branch. After that we have been told to (by toan) work on the migrated (new project) project. So I have forked the new repository and started working on my own branch, so did my team mate.
